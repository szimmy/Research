Research Prototype for Dr. Klassen of Rowan University.

The goal is to determine an algorithm for encapsulating a 4-D data cloud with the smallest possible 5-cell.

First we will determine an algorithm for finding the smallest triangle around a 2-D data set and try to use similar methods to arbitrate it to higher dimensions.
